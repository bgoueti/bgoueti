It takes in a combination of inputs and weights, multiplies them together, adds a bias term, and then passes the result through an activation function. The result of this process is what the neuron will pass onto the subsequent layer. Neural Network nodes are modeled after the neurons in the human brain. They have a activation function that decides how much signal to pass onto other neurons. In the human brain there is an electrochemical threshold that decides when and when not to fire.\n",

These nodes perform the same operations as all others, but are not directly accessible during training. Having multiple hidden layers in a neural network architecture is what determines the designation of \"Deep Learning.\"\n",
        "- **Output Layer:** The final layer of our neural network, the output layer outputs our model's final predictions. For regression problems this is a single node that outputs a continuous value. For binary classification, it is a single node that outputs a probability between 0 & 1, and for multi-class implementations the output layer typically includes a node for each of the classes that we are trying to predict.\n",

        "\n",
        "A simple perceptron can only learn a linear decision boundary as seen in the visualization above. Since the data points are distributed in a way where only a single class is represented per quadrant, a linear decision boundary can never reach an accuracy much higher than about 50% since each class will be equally represented on either side of that linear decision boundary.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) What is the architectural property of the Multi-Layer Perceptron that allows it to more accurately learn the relationship between X and Y?\n",
        "\n",
        "The additional layers and neurons allow a neural networks to learn non-linear relationships between X and Y. Each layer in a neural net represents an N-dimensional vector space. So by passing data from one layer to another, we are passing a data vector from one vector space to another, each with a different dimensions, often times this will change the geometry of the data points (i.e. their distribution in space) in such a way where a linear separation then becomes possible. This is the same idea behind the Kernel Trick in Support Vector Machines (SVM)."
